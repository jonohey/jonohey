Bill Gates said:

>"This is such a cool book. The range of Jono’s knowledge is astounding, and so is his ability to digest complex ideas into deceptively simple drawings. You’ll learn something on every page—and be entertained too."

And who am I to disagree?

We lived in California for nearly 7 years. While we were there we travelled to some amazing places. In this book, we collected together the best shots from the best places we visited. If nothing else, check out the map on page 7 for some ideas.

## Mindmap travel journal

At the end of 2009, we traveled for seven months across Central America, Southeast Asia and South Africa. During that time, we wrote our travel journal in the form of a mindmap (Issuu, which handled the embed, changed their plan annoyingly, so sadly, the embed with lovely page turning has broken. I'll get to fixing it).
